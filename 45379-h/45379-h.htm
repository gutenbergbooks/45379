<h2><a name="Chapter_I" id="Chapter_I">Chapter I</a><br />

<small>The Picnic</small></h2>


<p>On the great western prairies of Dakota
is a little town called Edgeley, because
it is on the edge of civilization&mdash;a
very big word which means some folks
have found a better way to live than other
folks. The Edgeley people have a good
way to live, for there are almost seventeen
wooden houses there, and among them is a
school-house, a church, a store and a blacksmith-shop.
If people walked out their front
doors they were upon the little street; if
they walked out the back doors they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
on the broad prairies. That was why
Twinkle, who was a farmer's little girl, lived
so near the town that she could easily walk
to school.</p>

<p>She was a pretty, rosy-cheeked little thing,
with long, fluffy hair, and big round eyes
that everybody smiled into when they saw
them. It was hard to keep that fluffy hair
from getting tangled; so mamma used to tie
it in the back with a big, broad ribbon.
And Twinkle wore calico slips for school
days and gingham dresses when she wanted
to "dress up" or look especially nice. And
to keep the sun from spotting her face with
freckles, she wore sunbonnets made of the
same goods as her dresses.</p>

<p>Twinkle's best chum was a little boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a><br /><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
called Chubbins, who was the only child
of the tired-faced school-teacher. Chubbins
was about as old as Twinkle; but he wasn't
so tall and slender for his age as she was,
being short and rather fat. The hair on his
little round head was cut close, and he usually
wore a shirt-waist and "knickers," with
a wide straw hat on the back of his head.
Chubbins's face was very solemn. He never
said many words when grown folks were
around, but he could talk fast enough when
he and Twinkle were playing together alone.</p>

</div>

<p>Well, one Saturday the school had a picnic,
and Twinkle and Chubbins both went.
On the Dakota prairies there are no shade-trees
at all, and very little water except
what they get by boring deep holes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
in the ground; so you may wonder where
the people could possibly have a picnic.
But about three miles from the town a little
stream of water (which they called a "river,"
but we would call only a brook) ran slow
and muddy across the prairie; and where
the road crossed it a flat bridge had been
built. If you climbed down the banks of
the river you would find a nice shady place
under the wooden bridge; and so here it was
that the picnics were held.</p>

<p>All the village went to the picnic, and
they started bright and early in the morning,
with horses and farm-wagons, and baskets
full of good things to eat, and soon arrived
at the bridge.</p>

<p>There was room enough in its shade for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
all to be comfortable; so they unhitched the
horses and carried the baskets to the river
bank, and began to laugh and be as merry as
they could.</p>

<p>Twinkle and Chubbins, however, didn't
care much for the shade of the bridge. This
was a strange place to them, so they decided
to explore it and see if it was any different
from any other part of the prairie. Without
telling anybody where they were going, they
took hold of hands and trotted across the
bridge and away into the plains on the other
side.</p>

<p>The ground here wasn't flat, but had long
rolls to it, like big waves on the ocean, so
that as soon as the little girl and boy had
climbed over the top of the first wave, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
hill, those by the river lost sight of them.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>They saw nothing but grass in the first
hollow, but there was another hill just beyond,
so they kept going, and climbed over
that too. And now they found, lying in the
second hollow, one of the most curious sights
that the western prairies afford.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Chubbins, wonderingly.</p>

<p>"Why, it's a Prairie-Dog Town," said
Twinkle.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="Chapter_II" id="Chapter_II">Chapter II</a><br />

<small>Prairie-Dog Town</small></h2>


<p>Lying in every direction, and quite
filling the little hollow, were round
mounds of earth, each one having a hole
in the center. The mounds were about
two feet high and as big around as a wash-tub,
and the edges of the holes were pounded
hard and smooth by the pattering feet of
the little creatures that lived within.</p>

<p>"Isn't it funny!" said Chubbins, staring
at the mounds.</p>

<p>"Awful," replied Twinkle, staring too.
"Do you know, Chub, there are an'mals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
living in every single one of those holes?"</p>

<p>"What kind?" asked Chubbins.</p>

<p>"Well, they're something like squirrels,
only they <em>aren't</em> squirrels," she explained.
"They're prairie-dogs."</p>

<p>"Don't like dogs," said the boy, looking
a bit uneasy.</p>

<p>"Oh, they're not dogs at all," said
Twinkle; "they're soft and fluffy, and
gentle."</p>

<p>"Do they bark?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes; but they don't bite."</p>

<p>"How d' you know, Twink?"</p>

<p>"Papa has told me about them, lots of
times. He says they're so shy that they run
into their holes when anybody's around;
but if you keep quiet and watch, they'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
stick their heads out in a few minutes."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 428px;">
<img src="images/i015.jpg" width="428" height="600" alt="WATCHING" />
<span class="caption">WATCHING</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let's watch," said Chubbins.</p>

<p>"All right," she agreed.</p>

<p>Very near to some of the mounds was a
raised bank, covered with soft grass; so the
children stole softly up to this bank and lay
down upon it in such a way that their heads
just stuck over the top of it, while their
bodies were hidden from the eyes of any of
the folks of Prairie-Dog Town.</p>

<p>"Are you comferble, Chub?" asked the
little girl.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then lie still and don't talk, and keep
your eyes open, and perhaps the an'mals
will stick their heads up."</p>

<p>"All right," says Chubbins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>So they kept quiet and waited, and it
seemed a long time to both the boy and the
girl before a soft, furry head popped out of
a near-by hole, and two big, gentle brown
eyes looked at them curiously.</p>

<small>Mr. Bowko, the Mayor</small></h2>


<p>"Dear me!" said the prairie-dog, speaking
almost in a whisper; "here are
some of those queer humans from the
village."</p>

<p>"Let me see! Let me see!" cried two
shrill little voices, and the wee heads of two
small creatures popped out of the hole and
fixed their bright eyes upon the heads of
Twinkle and Chubbins.</p>

<p>"Go down at once!" said the mother
prairie-dog. "Do you want to get hurt, you
naughty little things?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">"GO DOWN AT ONCE"</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, they won't get hurt," said another
deeper voice, and the children turned their
eyes toward a second mound, on top of
which sat a plump prairie-dog whose reddish
fur was tipped with white on the end of
each hair. He seemed to be quite old, or at
least well along in years, and he had a wise
and thoughtful look on his face.</p>

<p>"They're humans," said the mother.</p>

<p>"True enough; but they're only human
children, and wouldn't hurt your little ones
for the world," the old one said.</p>

<p>"That's so!" called Twinkle. "All we
want, is to get acquainted."</p>

<p>"Why, in that case," replied the old prairie-dog,
"you are very welcome in our town,
and we're glad to see you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you," said Twinkle, gratefully. It
didn't occur to her just then that it was
wonderful to be talking to the little prairie-dogs
just as if they were people. It seemed
very natural they should speak with each
other and be friendly.</p>

<p>As if attracted by the sound of voices,
little heads began to pop out of the other
mounds&mdash;one here and one there&mdash;until the
town was alive with the pretty creatures, all
squatting near the edges of their holes and
eyeing Chubbins and Twinkle with grave
and curious looks.</p>

<p>"Let me introduce myself," said the old
one that had first proved friendly. "My
name is Bowko, and I'm the Mayor and
High Chief of Prairie-Dog Town."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't you have a king?" asked Twinkle.</p>

<p>"Not in this town," he answered. "There
seems to be no place for kings in this free
United States. And a Mayor and High
Chief is just as good as a king, any day."</p>

<p>"I think so, too," answered the girl.</p>

<p>"Better!" declared Chubbins.</p>

<p>The Mayor smiled, as if pleased.</p>

<p>"I see you've been properly brought up,"
he continued; "and now let me introduce
to you some of my fellow-citizens. This,"
pointing with one little paw to the hole
where the mother and her two children were
sitting, "is Mrs. Puff-Pudgy and her family&mdash;Teenty
and Weenty. Mr. Puff-Pudgy, I
regret to say, was recently chased out of
town for saying his prayers backwards."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 410px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>"How could he?" asked Chubbins, much
surprised.</p>

<p>"He was always contrary," answered the
Mayor, with a sigh, "and wouldn't do
things the same way that others did. His
good wife, Mrs. Puff-Pudgy, had to scold
him all day long; so we finally made him
leave the town, and I don't know where
he's gone to."</p>

<p>"Won't he be sorry not to have his little
children any more?" asked Twinkle, regretfully.</p>

<p>"I suppose so; but if people are contrary,
and won't behave, they must take the consequences.
This is Mr. Chuckledorf," continued
the Mayor, and a very fat prairie-dog
bowed to them most politely; "and here is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Mrs. Fuzcum; and Mrs. Chatterby; and Mr.
Sneezeley, and Doctor Dosem."</p>

<p>All these folks bowed gravely and politely,
and Chubbins and Twinkle bobbed their
heads in return until their necks ached, for it
seemed as if the Mayor would never get
through introducing the hundreds of prairie-dogs
that were squatting around.</p>

<p>"I'll never be able to tell one from the
other," whispered the girl; "'cause they all
look exactly alike."</p>

<p>"Some of 'em 's fatter," observed Chubbins;
"but I don't know which."</p>

<small>Presto Digi, the Magician</small></h2>


<p>"And now, if you like, we will be
pleased to have you visit some of
our houses," said Mr. Bowko, the Mayor,
in a friendly tone.</p>

<p>"But we can't!" exclaimed Twinkle.
"We're too big," and she got up and sat
down upon the bank, to show him how big
she really was when compared with the prairie-dogs.</p>

<p>"Oh, that doesn't matter in the least,"
the Mayor replied. "I'll have Presto Digi,
our magician, reduce you to our size."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>"Can he?" asked Twinkle, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Our magician can do anything," declared
the Mayor. Then he sat up and put
both his front paws to his mouth and made
a curious sound that was something like a
bark and something like a whistle, but not
exactly like either one.</p>

<p>Then everybody waited in silence until
a queer old prairie-dog slowly put his head
out of a big mound near the center of the
village.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Presto Digi," said
the Mayor.</p>

<p>"Morning!" answered the magician,
blinking his eyes as if he had just awakened
from sleep.</p>

<p>Twinkle nearly laughed at this scrawny,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
skinny personage; but by good fortune, for
she didn't wish to offend him, she kept
her face straight and did not even smile.</p>

<p>"We have two guests here, this morning,"
continued the Mayor, addressing the
magician, "who are a little too large to get
into our houses. So, as they are invited
to stay to luncheon, it would please us all
if you would kindly reduce them to fit our
underground rooms."</p>

<p>"Is <em>that</em> all you want?" asked Mr. Presto
Digi, bobbing his head at the children.</p>

<p>"It seems to me a great deal," answered
Twinkle. "I'm afraid you never could do
it."</p>

<p>"Wow!" said the magician, in a scornful
voice that was almost a bark. "I can do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
that with one paw. Come here to me, and
don't step on any of our mounds while
you're so big and clumsy."</p>

<p>So Twinkle and Chubbins got up and
walked slowly toward the magician, taking
great care where they stepped. Teenty and
Weenty were frightened, and ducked their
heads with little squeals as the big children
passed their mound; but they bobbed up
again the next moment, being curious to
see what would happen.</p>

<p>When the boy and girl stopped before Mr.
Presto Digi's mound, he began waving one
of his thin, scraggy paws and at the same
time made a gurgling noise that was deep
down in his throat. And his eyes rolled
and twisted around in a very odd way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>Neither Twinkle nor Chubbins felt any
effect from the magic, nor any different from
ordinary; but they knew they were growing
smaller, because their eyes were getting
closer to the magician.</p>

<p>"Is that enough?" asked Mr. Presto,
after a while.</p>

<p>"Just a little more, please," replied the
Mayor; "I don't want them to bump their
heads against the doorways."</p>

<p>So the magician again waved his paw and
chuckled and gurgled and blinked, until
Twinkle suddenly found she had to look up
at him as he squatted on his mound.</p>

<p>"Stop!" she screamed; "if you keep on,
we won't be anything at all!"</p>

<p>"You're just about the right size," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
the Mayor, looking them over with much
pleasure, and when the girl turned around
she found Mr. Bowko and Mrs. Puff-Pudgy
standing beside her, and she could easily
see that Chubbins was no bigger than they,
and she was no bigger than Chubbins.</p>

<p>"Kindly follow me," said Mrs. Puff-Pudgy,
"for my little darlings are anxious
to make your acquaintance, and as I was
the first to discover you, you are to be my
guests first of all, and afterward go to the
Mayor's to luncheon."</p>

<small>The Home of the Puff-Pudgys</small></h2>


<p>So Twinkle and Chubbins, still holding
hands, trotted along to the Puff-Pudgy
mound, and it was strange how
rough the ground now seemed to their tiny
feet. They climbed up the slope of the
mound rather clumsily, and when they
came to the hole it seemed to them as big
as a well. Then they saw that it wasn't
a deep hole, but a sort of tunnel leading
down hill into the mound, and Twinkle
knew if they were careful they were not
likely to slip or tumble down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 430px;">

<span class="caption">THE GROUND NOW SEEMED ROUGH TO THEIR TINY FEET</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Puff-Pudgy popped into the hole
like a flash, for she was used to it, and
waited just below the opening to guide
them. So, Twinkle slipped down to the
floor of the tunnel and Chubbins followed
close after her, and then they began to go
downward.</p>

<p>"It's a little dark right here," said Mrs.
Puff-Pudgy; "but I've ordered the maid to
light the candles for you, so you'll see well
enough when you're in the rooms."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Twinkle, walking along
the hall and feeling her way by keeping her
hand upon the smooth sides of the passage.
"I hope you won't go to any trouble, or
put on airs, just because we've come to
visit you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>"If I do," replied Mrs. Puffy-Pudgy, "it's
because I know the right way to treat company.
We've always belonged to the 'four
hundred,' you know. Some folks never
know what to do, or how to do it, but that
isn't the way with the Puff-Pudgys. Hi!
you, Teenty and Weenty&mdash;get out of here
and behave yourselves! You'll soon have
a good look at our visitors."</p>

<p>And now they came into a room so comfortable
and even splendid that Twinkle's
eyes opened wide with amazement.</p>

<p>It was big, and of a round shape, and on
the walls were painted very handsome portraits
of different prairie-dogs of the Puff-Pudgy
family. The furniture was made of
white clay, baked hard in the sun and decorated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
with paints made from blue clay and
red clay and yellow clay. This gave it a
gorgeous appearance. There was a round
table in the middle of the room, and several
comfortable chairs and sofas. Around the
walls were little brackets with candles in
them, lighting the place very pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Sit down, please," said Mrs. Puff-Pudgy.
"You'll want to rest a minute before I show
you around."</p>

<p>So Twinkle and Chubbins sat upon the
pretty clay chairs, and Teenty and Weenty
sat opposite them and stared with their
mischievous round eyes as hard as they
could.</p>

<p>"What nice furniture," exclaimed the girl.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Mrs. Puff-Pudgy, looking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a><br /><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>up at the picture of a sad-faced prairie-dog;
"Mr. Puff-Pudgy made it all himself. He
was very handy at such things. It's a
shame he turned out so obstinate."</p>

<span class="caption">MR PUFF-PUDGY'S POTRAIT</span>
</div>

<p>"Did he build the house too?"</p>

<p>"Why, he dug it out, if that's what you
mean. But I advised him how to do it, so
I deserve some credit for it myself. Next
to the Mayor's, it's the best house in
town, which accounts for our high social
standing. Weenty! take your paw out of
your mouth. You're biting your claws
again."</p>

<p>"I'm not!" said Weenty.</p>

<p>"And now," continued Mrs. Puff-Pudgy,
"if you are rested, I'll show you through
the rest of our house."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>So, they got up and followed her, and she
led the children through an archway into
the dining-room. Here was a cupboard full
of the cunningest little dishes Twinkle had
ever seen. They were all made of clay,
baked hard in the sun, and were of graceful
shapes, and nearly as smooth and perfect
as our own dishes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<h2><a name="Chapter_VI" id="Chapter_VI">Chapter VI</a><br />

<small>Teenty and Weenty</small></h2>

<p>All around the sides of the dining-room
were pockets, or bins, in the
wall; and these were full of those things
the prairie-dogs are most fond of eating.
Clover-seeds filled one bin, and sweet
roots another; dried mulberry leaves&mdash;that
must have come from a long distance&mdash;were
in another bin, and even kernels
of yellow field corn were heaped in one
place. The Puff-Pudgys were surely in no
danger of starving for some time to come.</p>

<p>"Teenty! Put back that grain of wheat,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a><br /><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
commanded the mother, in a severe voice.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i043.jpg" width="600" height="425" alt="THE CHILDREN EXAMINE THE DINING-ROOM" />
<span class="caption">THE CHILDREN EXAMINE THE DINING-ROOM</span>
</div>

<p>Instead of obeying, Teenty put the wheat
in his mouth and ate it as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>"The little dears are <em>so</em> restless," Mrs.
Puff-Pudgy said to Twinkle, "that it's hard
to manage them."</p>

<p>"They don't behave," remarked Chubbins,
staring hard at the children.</p>

<p>"No, they have a share of their father's
obstinate nature," replied Mrs. Puff-Pudgy.
"Excuse me a minute and I'll cuff them;
It'll do them good."</p>

<p>But before their mother could reach them,
the children found trouble of their own.
Teenty sprang at Weenty and began to
fight, because his brother had pinched him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
and Weenty fought back with all his might
and main. They scratched with their claws
and bit with their teeth, and rolled over
and over upon the floor, bumping into the
wall and upsetting the chairs, and snarling
and growling all the while like two puppies.</p>

<p>Mrs. Puff-Pudgy sat down and watched
them, but did not interfere.</p>

<p>"Won't they hurt themselves?" asked
Twinkle, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Perhaps so," said the mother; "but if
they do, it will punish them for being so
naughty. I always let them fight it out,
because they are so sore for a day or two
afterward that they have to keep quiet, and
then I get a little rest."</p>

<p>Weenty set up a great howling, just then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
and Teenty drew away from his defeated
brother and looked at him closely. The
fur on both of them was badly mussed up,
and Weenty had a long scratch on his nose,
that must have hurt him, or he wouldn't
have howled so. Teenty's left eye was
closed tight, but if it hurt him he bore the
pain in silence.</p>

<p>Mrs. Puff-Pudgy now pushed them both
into a little room and shut them up, saying
they must stay there until bedtime; and
then she led Twinkle and Chubbins into the
kitchen and showed them a pool of clear
water, in a big clay basin, that had been
caught during the last rain and saved for
drinking purposes. The children drank of
it, and found it cool and refreshing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>Then they saw the bedrooms, and learned
that the beds of prairie-dogs were nothing
more than round hollows made in heaps of
clay. These animals always curl themselves
up when they sleep, and the round
hollows just fitted their bodies; so, no
doubt, they found them very comfortable.</p>

<p>There were several bedrooms, for the
Puff-Pudgy house was really very large. It
was also very cool and pleasant, being all
underground and not a bit damp.</p>

<p>After they had admired everything in a
way that made Mrs. Puff-Pudgy very proud
and happy, their hostess took one of the
lighted candles from a bracket and said she
would now escort them to the house of the
Honorable Mr. Bowko, the Mayor.</p>

<small>The Mayor Gives a Luncheon</small></h2>


<p>"Don't we have to go upstairs and
out of doors?" asked Twinkle.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," replied the prairie-dog, "we
have halls connecting all the different
houses of importance. Just follow me,
and you can't get lost."</p>

<p>They might easily have been lost without
their guide, the little girl thought, after
they had gone through several winding
passages. They turned this way and that,
in quite a bewildering manner, and there
were so many underground tunnels going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
in every direction that it was a wonder
Mrs. Puff-Pudgy knew which way to go.</p>

<p>"You ought to have sign-posts," said
Chubbins, who had once been in a city.</p>

<p>"Why, as for that, every one in the town
knows which way to go," answered their
guide; "and it isn't often we have visitors.
Last week a gray owl stopped with us for a
couple of days, and we had a fine ball in
her honor. But you are the first humans
that have ever been entertained in our
town, so it's quite an event with us." A
few minutes later she said: "Here we are,
at the Mayor's house," and as they passed
under a broad archway she blew out her
candle, because the Mayor's house was so
brilliantly lighted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 428px;">

<span class="caption">THE LUNCHEON AT THE MAYOR'S</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>"Welcome!" said Mr. Bowko, greeting
the children with polite bows. "You are
just in time, for luncheon is about ready
and my guests are waiting for you."</p>

<p>He led them at once into a big dining-room
that was so magnificently painted
with colored clays that the walls were as
bright as June rainbow.</p>

<p>"How pretty!" cried Twinkle, clapping
her hands together in delight.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you like it," said the Mayor,
much pleased. "Some people, who are
lacking in good taste, think it's a little
overdone, but a Mayor's house should be
gorgeous, I think, so as to be a credit to
the community. My grandfather, who designed
and painted this house, was a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
fine artist. But luncheon is ready, so pray
be seated."</p>

<p>They sat down on little clay chairs that
were placed at the round table. The Mayor
sat on one side of Twinkle and Mrs. Puff-Pudgy
on the other, and Chubbins was between
the skinny old magician and Mr.
Sneezeley. Also, in other chairs sat Dr.
Dosem, and Mrs. Chatterby, and Mrs. Fuzcum,
and several others. It was a large company,
indeed, which showed that the Mayor
considered this a very important occasion.</p>

<p>They were waited upon by several sleek
prairie-dog maids in white aprons and white
caps, who looked neat and respectable, and
were very graceful in their motions.</p>

<p>Neither Twinkle nor Chubbins was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
hungry, but they were curious to know what
kind of food the prairie-dogs ate, so they
watched carefully when the different dishes
were passed around. Only grains and
vegetables were used, for prairie-dogs do
not eat meat. There was a milk-weed soup
at first; and then yellow corn, boiled and
sliced thin. Afterward they had a salad
of thistle leaves, and some bread made of
barley. The dessert was a dish of the sweet,
dark honey made by prairie-bees, and some
cakes flavored with sweet and spicy roots
that only prairie-dogs know how to find.</p>

<p>The children tasted of several dishes, just
to show their politeness; but they couldn't
eat much. Chubbins spent most of his
time watching Mr. Presto Digi, who ate up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a><br /><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>everything that was near him and seemed
to be as hungry after the luncheon as he
had been before.</p>

<span class="caption">MRS FUZCUM SINGING</span>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Puff-Pudgy talked so much about
the social standing and dignity of the Puff-Pudgys
that she couldn't find time to eat
much, although she asked for the recipe of
the milk-weed soup. But most of the others
present paid strict attention to the meal
and ate with very good appetites.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<small>On Top of the Earth Again</small></h2>


<p>Afterward they all went into the
big drawing-room, where Mrs. Fuzcum
sang a song for them in a very shrill
voice, and Mr. Sneezeley and Mrs. Chatterby
danced a graceful minuet that was much
admired by all present.</p>

<p>"We ought to be going home," said
Twinkle, after this entertainment was
over. "I'm afraid our folks will worry
about us."</p>

<p>"We regret to part with you," replied
the Mayor; "but, if you really think you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
ought to go, we will not be so impolite as
to urge you to stay."</p>

<p>"You'll find we have excellent manners,"
added Mrs. Puff-Pudgy.</p>

<p>"I want to get big again," said Chubbins.</p>

<p>"Very well; please step this way," said
the Mayor.</p>

<p>So they all followed him through a long
passage until they began to go upward, as
if climbing a hill. And then a gleam of
daylight showed just ahead of them, and a
few more steps brought them to the hole in
the middle of the mound.</p>

<p>The Mayor and Mrs. Puff-Pudgy jumped
up first, and then they helped Twinkle and
Chubbins to scramble out. The strong sunlight
made them blink their eyes for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a><br /><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>time, but when they were able to look
around they found one or more heads of
prairie-dogs sticking from every mound.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Presto Digi," said the Mayor,
when all the party were standing on the
ground, "please enlarge our friends to their
natural sizes again."</p>

<p>"That is very easy," said the magician,
with a sigh. "I really wish, Mr. Mayor,
that you would find something for me to do
that is difficult."</p>

<p>"I will, some time," promised the Mayor.
"Just now, this is all I can require of you."</p>

<p>So the magician waved his paw and
gurgled, much in the same way he had done
before, and Twinkle and Chubbins began to
grow and swell out until they were as large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
as ever, and the prairie-dogs again seemed
very small beside them.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," said the little girl, "and
thank you all, very much, for your kindness
to us."</p>

<p>"Good-bye!" answered a chorus of small
voices, and then all the prairie-dogs popped
into their holes and quickly disappeared.</p>

<p>Twinkle and Chubbins found they were
sitting on the green bank again, at the edge
of Prairie-Dog Town.</p>

<p>"Do you think we've been asleep, Chub?"
asked the girl.</p>
